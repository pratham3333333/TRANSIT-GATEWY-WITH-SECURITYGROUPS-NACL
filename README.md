üõ†Ô∏è AWS Transit Gateway Topology with VPCs, Security Groups, and NACLs
This repository showcases a practical implementation of an advanced AWS network architecture. The project involves creating three VPCs, each with two subnets, and connecting them via a Transit Gateway. Additionally, custom Security Groups and Network ACLs are configured to secure SSH and ICMP traffic, enabling secure communication between the VPCs.

üéØ Project Overview
VPC Creation: Set up three VPCs (VPC1, VPC2, VPC3) with subnets across different availability zones.
Transit Gateway: Establish a Transit Gateway to connect the VPCs for seamless communication.
Security Configuration: Implement custom Security Groups and Network ACLs to allow SSH (port 22) and ICMP (ping) traffic between VPCs.
Testing: Launch EC2 instances and validate inter-VPC connectivity for SSH and ping.
